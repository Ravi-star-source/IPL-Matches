IPL Power BI Project
The IPL dataset provides insights into match results, team performances and player achievements across seasons. Key metrics include match winners, toss decisions and result margins. Cities like Mumbai, Bangalore and Kolkata host major games. Top performers earn "Player of the Match" awards. Analyzing trends in batting first VS chasing, super overs and target runs helps identify strategic patterns in team success.
